            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My fullname is Christopher Carin (They/Them). I am a graphic designer and multimedia artist based out of Toronto, Canada. My design work focuses around motion graphics, web design, and publication design. I enjoy coding and often revolve much of my personal work around the application of code in creative contexts. Outside of the visual realm, I also dabble with electronic music and sound design.</p>
