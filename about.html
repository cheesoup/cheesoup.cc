        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            My fullname is Christopher Carin (They/Them). I am a graphic designer & multimedia artist based out of Toronto, Canada. My design work focuses around motion graphics, web design, and publication design. I enjoy coding and often revolve much of my personal work around the application of code in creative contexts. Outside of the visual realm, I also dabble with electronic music and sound design.
