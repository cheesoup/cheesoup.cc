description: Flow is an audio/visual demo built entirely in HTML5/CSS and JavaScript. The requirement for this project was to simply create something using a JavaScript library. At the time, all I wanted to do was write music. Ultimately, I decided to twist this assignment into what I actually wanted to do, and thus flow was born. It makes use of ToneJS for the audio and P5JS for the visuals.
