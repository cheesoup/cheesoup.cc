description: Flow is an audio/visual demo built entirely in HTML5/CSS and JavaScript. It makes heavy use of the ToneJS library for the audio and the P5JS for the visuals. The requirement for this project was to simply create something using a JavaScript libraries. At the time, I really wanted to write to some music but felt too busy with the projects I had on my plate. Essentially, my solution was to twist this project into what I actually wanted to do.
