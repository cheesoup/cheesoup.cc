description: "2C is a fictional experimental techno artist loosely based on myself which I came up with for this project. Rather than a traditional musician, 2C fancies themselves to be a “computer music designer”. Their primary inspirations for music are the worlds programming, pure mathematics, computer engineering, and digital futurism. These inspirations are pulled from IDM artists such as Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, and U-ziq."
