description: This project was primarily inspired by a Red Bull talk provided by Terre Thaemlitz (aka DJ Sprinkles) on the gentrification of house music and the resulting loss of queer identity from the culture revolving around the music. My goal was to provide a map to explore the influence that led to house and influence house music has had since.
