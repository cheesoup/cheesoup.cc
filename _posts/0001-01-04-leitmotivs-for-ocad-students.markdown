description: Leitmotivs are essentially small musical phrases which composers use to represent a concept. They were originally used in German as a means of communicating story through music. To capture this concept in print form, I put together an accordion fold which was essentially a visual score to my (unhealthy) creative process at the time. The idea was to use simple shapes that I could easily transform throughout the course of a book. Through the transformation of these shapes, I hoped to convey a narrative about my stress and anxiety levels when working on a project (despite the bright colors and simple shapes).
