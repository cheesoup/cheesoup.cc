description: Leitmotivs, as made famous by Richard Wagner, are musical cues which are used to identify a specific character or themes throughout a narrative. Oftentimes, leitmotivs are transformed throughout a given work to reflect the status of the character or theme they represent. They are often merged with other leitmotivs as a means of representing character interaction. For this project, I was tasked with creating a one and half minute motion graphic which could represent this idea of leitmotivs. I chose to create an animated music video for Yasuaki Shimizu’s ‘Seiko 3’. The goal I had in mind was to visually represent the song’s development and the evolution of its primary motif over time through use of illustrated flora. Unfortunately due to copyright, I cannot upload this piece with audio without the risk of strike. I apologize.
