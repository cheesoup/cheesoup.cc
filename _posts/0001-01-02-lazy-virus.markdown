The Lazy Virus Show is a fictional television cartoon about an anthropomorphic Virus and their frequent misadventures in the post-post-modern world. The titular Lazy Virus was developed in Aseprite and was created as a kind of response to the COVID pandemic which had just begun at the time. To me, the idea of a Virus living like us humans do seemed humorous at the time. From a technical perspective, my primary goal was the integration of non-Adobe products into Adobe projects. I wanted to find value in other software essentially. From a final product perspective, my goal was just to create something light hearted and fun that my class would enjoy (despite the pandemic).
